# Hi, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹

### Here's what you need to know about me

Iâ€™m a Cloud Solution Architect @ Microsoft by day, working in the Customer Success team.

By night, I write a plucky little blog as a way for me to share my experiences and at times my opinion.

I probably best describe myself, for the most part, as a 12 year old trapped in a 30 something year oldâ€™s body. I think the fun part of life is what drives my personality and outlook. Being stressed and unhappy are just a road to, as someone great once said, "â€¦the path to the dark side. [Stress leads to anger.] Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."

I enjoy football (as its correctly called people!) otherwise known as soccer, come on Chelsea!; gaming (on PC#masterRace); Formula 1; MotoGP; Star Wars; cooking (my wife says Iâ€™m a MasterChef) and ofcourse laughing. You can never laugh enough too much in life.
