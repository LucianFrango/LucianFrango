# Hi, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹

### Here's what you need to know about me

I'm a Lead Microsoft Azure focussed Cloud Solution Architect by day with many of years of professional services consulting experience under my belt (don't remind me that I'm getting old). I work for Telstra Purple as part of the Workplace and Digital Apps group helping enterprise customers.

By night, I write a plucky little blog as a way for me to share my experiences and at times my opinion.

I probably best describe myself, for the most part, as a 12 year old trapped in a 30 something year old's body. I think the fun part of life is what drives my personality and outlook. Being stressed and unhappy are just a road to, as someone great once said, "â€¦the path to the dark side. Stress leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."

I enjoy football (as its correctly called people!) otherwise known as soccer, come on Chelsea! ðŸ”µ; gaming on PC; Formula 1 (#EssereFerrari ðŸ”´); MotoGP (#MonsterYamaha ðŸ”µ); Star Wars; cooking (really love that, but also eating) and laughing. You can never laugh enough in life.
